# feup-COMP

A tool to convert airport specification files in XML (obtained from FSX BGL files) into
SDL. In Flight Simulator X (FSX), airport information (as well as most scenery
information) is coded into BGL files. These are compiled from XML sources, and tools
such as Bgl2Xml [1] can decompile the information back into the XML format, which
contains much information regarding the physical and visual aspects of airports and other
simulation elements [2].
A framework developed at LIACC (for multi-vehicle mission simulation) uses a cut-down
format for specifying airports [3] (among other elements). The XML2SDL tool should be
able to parse the XML information generated by the Bgl2Xml tool and output the airport
information in the SDL format.
